# Developer's Cheat Sheet
A collection of useful commands, snippets, and reference links that I use all the time but still can't remember :sweat_smile:.

These commands are intended to be used as reference material, for the purposes of refreshing your memory. If you don't know what a command does, don't run it until you've looked it up and understand what it does.

Please also feel free to check out my [Administrator's Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/liaocanada/administrators-cheat-sheet).
